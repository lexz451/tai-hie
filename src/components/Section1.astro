                            A healthy ecosystem is dynamically balanced, with
                            diversity, resiliency, and integrity as defining
                            characteristics.

                            Adopting a systems-based approach enhances awareness
                            of resource allocation, identifies gaps, and
                            uncovers the interactions between different funders
                            and programming so that they can design more
                            meaningful and effective objective-oriented
                            interventions and support.

                            This approach enables the design of more meaningful
                            and effective objective-oriented interventions and
                            support within the ecosystem.

                            An ecosystem is a dynamic and flexible network
                            comprising interconnected systems and heterogeneous
                            species, including actors, institutions, and
                            technologies.

                            Coexistence and cooperative competition
                            (coopetition) among these elements sustain the
                            broader ecosystem while promoting individual
                            survival and growth.

                        <li>
                            Ecosystems are complex and multivariate, requiring
                            balance and resilience to absorb change, adapt, and
                            transform while maintaining consistent processes and
                            structures.

                            Ecosystems are not static; they possess persistent
                            structures shaped by their own history and exhibit a
                            stable participation of interconnecting groups of
                            people, their tools, and practices.
