                        A healthy information ecosystem is a well-balanced and
                        diverse system where information is created, shared, and
                        used responsibly. It allows individuals and communities
                        to access and analyze information for decision-making
                        and accountability. A healthy information ecosystem
                        operates through complex interactions between various
                        elements without a single controlling authority. It
                        emphasizes the diversity of information sources and
                        platforms, focusing on larger networks rather than
                        individuals. The ecosystem can be analyzed at different
                        levels, from local to global, with key aspects

                        Information ecosystems are a close reflection of our
                        interconnected world. Any ecosystem thrives on balance,
                        diversity, and resilience where various species can
                        coexist and interact. The same principles apply to
                        information ecosystems. Adopting a systems-based
                        approach enhances awareness of resource allocation,
                        identifies gaps, and uncovers the interactions between
                        different funders and programming so that they can
                        design more meaningful and effective objective-oriented
                        interventions and support. A reactive response alone is
                        insufficient: Collectively, funders need to think about
                        how to better support all the elements of the ecosystem
                        and how the streams of programming fit together. This is
                        the only way to live in an environment where information
                        nurtures, empowers, and sustains us all.
